**Notes:**

1.  **Navigation bar** to navigate between the different modules of the application.

2.  Overview of the project and dataset.

3.  Overview of climate trends and key climate highlights.

Upon launching the **Weather Pulse** Shiny application, users will be directed to the **landing page** which provides a brief introduction to the key features of the application, along with information about the dataset and its sources.

The right pane of the application features a overview of the trends for the respective climate variables and notable climate highlights. This area is designed to give a **quick snapshot** of the data trends based on the dataset utilised.

Use this section to familiarise yourself with the general climate trends and significant climate highlights captured in the dataset. This initial view serves as a gateway to the more detailed analysis available within the other sections of the application.

# 2.0 Module 1: Time Series Analysis

## 2.1 Sub-Module 1: Exploratory Data Analysis

This part of the application enables users to delve into the data through four types of interactive charts: **line chart, calendar heatmap, sunburst plot and STL decomposition**. Generally, users can expect:

-   **Interactive Selection**: Users can make selections using the tools on the left pane. The available selection methods include checkbox list for multiple selections and dropdown lists for single selections. This flexibility allow users to slice and dice the data according to their analysis as it enables them to filter and segment the data dynamically.

-   **Data Visualisation**: Upon making selections, the corresponding visualisations will render on the right pane, enabling users to immediately see the impact of their selections. Users can also hover over the visualisations for tooltips, which will display more detailed information.

## 2.2 Sub-Module 2: Time Series Forecasting

This sub-module enables users to project future weather conditions. In particular, users can select and compare across multiple forecasting models. Alternatively, they can run forecasts for different stations simultaneously.

### 2.2.1 Model Diagnostics

This function provides graphical analyses of the residuals to help evaluate model performance:

-   **Residuals Over Time**: Observing how residuals are spread over time can help detect patterns that the model fails to capture

-   **Autocorrelation Function (ACF) of Residuals**: This graph shows the correlation of residuals with their own lagged values. It helps to identify any autocorrelation that the model may not have accounted for.

-   **Histogram of Residuals**: This plot displays the distribution of the residuals. If the residuals are normally distributed, it indicates that the model is a good fit.
