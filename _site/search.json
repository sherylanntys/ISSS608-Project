    "text": "Southeast Asia is widely considered to be one of the regions that is most vulnerable to rising temperatures due to climate change and rapid urbanisation. People in this region are chronically exposed to the heat in the tropics, which is further exacerbated by the region’s high humidity1. Singapore is no exception, similarly experiencing rising temperatures.\nIn 2024, Singapore experienced one of its hottest years, tying with 2019 and 2016 as the warmest years on record2. Throughout the year, the temperatures recorded were equal to or greater than their long-term averages3. According to the Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS), the island is heating up twice as fast as the rest of the world4. This increase in temperatures is caused by a combination of global warming and the urban heat island effect, a phenomenon where urban areas become much warmer than rural areas as they are more built-up and densely populated.\nBesides rising temperatures, climate change has also led to more weather extremes in Singapore, with more frequent hot days and more extreme daily rainfall. In 2024, Singapore recorded above-average rainfall, averaging 2,739.8mm, which is 8.1% above the long-term average of 2,534.3mm5.\nThese extreme climate changes pose severe risks to public health, causing increased heat stress, dehydration, and heat-related illnesses, particularly among vulnerable populations like the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions6. It may also result in other indirect climate challenges, such as disruptions to water and food supply.\nGiven the complexity of Singapore’s climate challenges, there is a need for effective and comprehensive visual analytics. This would enhance understanding and communication of these climate trends by visualising complex data in an intuitive and accessible format."

    "text": "4.1 Exploratory & Confirmatory Data Analysis Module\n\n4.1.1 Exploratory Data Analysis Sub-Module\n\n\n\n\n\nThis module provides a variety of visualization tools designed to help users gain an initial understanding of the dataset, uncover underlying patterns, and formulate hypotheses for further analysis.\nSome of tools used would include:\n\nRidgeline Plots: These are utilized to visualize the distributions of variables like mean temperature or daily rainfall across different weather stations. The ggridges package will be employed to create these plots, which are effective for comparing multiple distributions and highlighting variations in data across different locations.\nLine Charts: Essential for tracking changes and trends in climate metrics such as mean temperature and rainfall over time. These charts allow users to follow the progression of these variables, helping to identify periods of unusual activity or notable stability. Line charts will be generated using the ggplot2 package.\nCalendar Heatmap: Used for examining patterns in daily climate data. By mapping the climate variables to a calendar layout, users can easily identify seasonal trends and persistent anomalies over time. The ggplot2 package will be used to create the calendar heatmaps.\n\nUsers will have the flexibility to select variables of interest and segment data into subsets for further exploration.\n\n\n4.1.2 Confirmatory Data Analysis Sub-Module\n\n\n\n\n\nThe primary analytical tool used in the modules will be the ggbetweenstats() function, which enables users to perform one-way ANOVA tests. This statistical test is used for comparing means across multiple groups to determine statistical significance, i.e. assessing variations in climate data such as temperature or rainfall across different weather stations.\nThe results from these tests will be visualised using a combination of box and violin plots, which provides a comprehensive view of data distributions across categories, highlighting differences in means, medians and interquartile ranges. The visual representation would help users to easily identify and understand variations and patterns across groups.\nUsers will have the flexibility to select variables of interest (e.g. mean temperature, daily rainfall, etc.) and toggle between different types and confidence levels to further tailor and deepen their exploration of the data."

    "text": "4.2 Time-Series Analysis & Forecasting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.1 Time-Series Analysis Sub-Module\nThis module focuses on decomposing the time series data into its constituent components – trend, seasonality and residual. We will utilise the STL() function from the feasts package, which applies Seasonal-Trend decomposition using Loess. The decomposition allows for a detailed examination of underlying patterns, and serves as a foundation for subsequent forecasts.\n\n\n4.2.2 Time-Series Forecasting Sub-Module\nThis module will focus on generating short-term and long-term climate forecasts using statistical models. ARIMA models tend to perform well in the prediction of variables such as global temperature and precipitation9. Therefore, we will implement the ARIMA model in our time-series forecasting.\nTo achieve this, we will use the model function from the fable package to fit ARIMA models and generate forecasts. Additionally, the autoplot() function will be used to visualise forecasted trends against historical data.\nForecasted results will be presented using line charts, allowing uses to compare predicted values with historical trends. Users will have the flexibility to adjust forecasts to explore both short-term and long-term predictions, as well as specify confidence intervals to account for uncertainty in the forecasts."

The tmap package will be used to generate these maps, while the sf package will manage and manipulate spatial data, ensuring precise alignment of climate data with Singapore’s geographical boundaries.\nWe will extract the relevant shapefiles from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) website and integrate geographical coordinates of weather stations to map the climate data across Singapore."
